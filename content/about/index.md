Hello, Iâ€™m John Chaplin!

I am a self-motivated professional, who has experience powering through on difficult projects and working with a large multi-disciplined team to complete objectives. I approach work at an organizational level and always look for ways to help the organization meet its goals. Since completing my degree in 2013 I spent nearly five years as an investment banker and developed an expansive skill set through over $30 Bn worth of transactions. Since leaving investment banking I have spent time in consulting roles and now as a Technical Advisor leading ML adoption in oil and gas for Novi Labs.
