Hello, Iâ€™m John Chaplin!

I am a self-motivated professional, who has experience powering through on difficult projects and working with a large multi-disciplined team to complete objectives. I approach work at an organizational level and always look for ways to help the organization meet its goals. Since completing my degree in 2013 I spent nearly five years as an investment banker and developed an expansive skill set through over $30 Bn worth of transactions. In February of 2018, I had the opportunity to pursue a personal goal and passion of mine to travel solo to the other side of the world, and so I left my career in investment banking behind. Since then I have gone to over 10+ countries and had the opportunity to meet and mix with so many new cultures and people.
